# Meal Planning Shiny App
### Matthew Wilcox

## Background
Here is a Meal-Planning App I built for my Data Visualization Class. My goal was to calculate meal Macros and track how many of those macros someone may have over the course of a week.

## API Usage
The project uses API's from CalorieNinja[^1] and TheMealDB[^2]. CaloriesNinja api refrences a Natural Language Model to determine the caloric content of a recipe
